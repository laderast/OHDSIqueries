I pulled a few of the queries that were calculated by Achilles so we can spot check.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#load DB connection info (not saved in repo)
source("connect.R")
library(Achilles)
connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(dbms="postgresql", server=server,user = user,
                                             password = password,schema=schema)

#load the names of each achilles query
achillesQueries <- getAnalysisDetails()
```

##Query 2: Number of People by Gender

This is a fairly simple query. 

```{r}
queryNum <- 2
achillesResult <- fetchAchillesAnalysisResults(connectionDetails,resultsDatabase = "public", analysisId = queryNum)

achillesResult
```

```{r}
exportToJson(connectionDetails, "public", "public", "~/Code/AchillesWeb/data/OHDSI")
```
